This is a side project of mine. It's an attempt to revamp this old looking site [Boston Hipnosis](https://www.bostonhypnosis.com/) site to give it a modern look. It's under development and its purpose is to practice my design and programming skills in my free time and also use as part of my portfolio.

## Technical notes
1. I mixed Tailwindcss with RadixUI and the result is pretty satisfactory. I liked RadixUI more than HeadlessUI. It's more complete and more accessible and it's also pretty easy to style with Tailwind.
